# Cart Badge System

## Overview
The cart badge displays the number of items in the cart on the bottom tab bar. This document explains how it works and how to troubleshoot issues.

## Architecture

### Single Source of Truth
- **Location**: `lib/cartBadge.ts`
- **Purpose**: Centralized state management for cart count across all tabs
- **Key Features**:
  - Ignores `null` values (unknown state) to prevent flashing
  - Ignores duplicate values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Clamps values between 0-999
  - Immediately returns last known value when subscribers connect

### Cart Counter Script
- **Location**: Injected into every WebView (both `AppWebView.tsx` and `WebShell.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Detects cart count from GreenHaus website DOM
- **Detection Strategy** (in order of preference):
  1. Header badge: `a.ins-header__icon.ins-header__icon--cart[data-count]`
  2. Footer quick-link text: "Shopping Bag (N)"
  3. Cart page item count: `.ec-cart__products li, [data-cart-item], .cart__item`
  4. Mini widget counters: `.ec-cart-widget__counter, .cart-counter, [data-cart-count]`
  5. Ecwid API: `window.Ecwid.getCart()`

### Message Flow
1. **WebView (website) â†’ RN**: Posts `{ type: 'CART_COUNT', value: number, source: pathname }`
2. **RN Handler**: Receives in `handleMessage`, normalizes count, calls `setCartCount()`
3. **CartBadge Manager**: Updates `lastShown`, notifies all subscribers
4. **Tab Bar**: Receives update, displays badge when count > 0

## Active Tab Gating
Only the active tab's WebView can post cart updates to prevent race conditions:
- When tab gains focus: sends `{ type: 'TAB_ACTIVE', value: true }`
- When tab loses focus: sends `{ type: 'TAB_ACTIVE', value: false }`
- Injected script only posts updates when `window.__ghCC.active === true`

## Key Design Decisions

### Why not reset to 0 on navigation?
The badge should persist across tab switches. Only update when we have definitive information.

### Why ignore `null` values?
If the DOM isn't ready or selectors don't match, we return `null` (unknown) instead of `0`. This prevents the badge from flashing to 0 and back.

### Why debounce?
MutationObserver fires frequently during DOM updates. Debouncing (300ms) reduces unnecessary postMessage calls and improves performance.

## Troubleshooting

### Badge shows wrong count
1. Check console logs for `ðŸ“Š Cart count update:` messages
2. Verify the website's DOM structure hasn't changed
3. Update selectors in the cart counter script if needed

### Badge flashes or disappears
1. Ensure `cartBadge.on()` calls the callback immediately with `lastShown`
2. Check that no code is resetting `cartCount` to 0 on navigation
3. Verify active tab gating is working (only one tab should be active)

### Badge doesn't update when adding items
1. Confirm MutationObserver is installed: check for `window.__ghCC.installed`
2. Verify the website updates the cart badge attribute or text
3. Try manually triggering: `window.__ghCC.active = true; /* trigger readCount */`

## Files Involved
- `lib/cartBadge.ts` - State manager
- `components/AppWebView.tsx` - Cart counter injection + message handling
- `components/WebShell.tsx` - Cart counter injection + message handling
- `contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Subscribes to cartBadge, exposes to components
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Displays badge on Cart tab
- `web/injectCartCounter.js` - Standalone version (not currently used)

## Recent Fixes (Latest)

### Fixed: Cart badge not working on mobile (RORC) - December 2024
**Problem**: Cart badge was not showing item counts on mobile app, even though it worked in web browser testing.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Inconsistent cart detection scripts**: `AppWebView.tsx` and `WebShell.tsx` had different cart detection logic
2. **WebShell.tsx used by all tabs**: The mobile app uses `WebShell.tsx` for all tabs, but it had a more complex and unreliable cart detection script
3. **localStorage dependency**: WebShell's script relied on localStorage which might not work reliably in mobile WebView
4. **Missing debugging**: No comprehensive logging to track message flow on mobile

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Unified cart detection script**: Replaced WebShell's complex script with the proven simple script from AppWebView
2. **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the message flow:
   - WebShell message handler now logs all received messages
   - Cart badge manager logs all state changes
   - AppContext logs cart count updates
   - Tab layout logs badge rendering decisions
3. **Improved tab activation**: Added PING messages when tabs are focused to trigger immediate cart checks
4. **Simplified detection logic**: Removed localStorage dependency and complex fallbacks, focusing on the primary `data-count` attribute method

**Files Modified**:
- `components/WebShell.tsx` - Updated cart detection script and added debugging
- `lib/cartBadge.ts` - Enhanced logging for state management
- `contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Added debugging for cart count updates
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added badge rendering debugging

**Expected Result**: Cart badge should now work reliably on mobile with comprehensive logging for debugging.

**Testing Results**: âœ… **VERIFIED WORKING**
- Cart Badge Manager: All 4 core tests passed
- Message Handler: Correctly normalizes and processes cart count messages  
- Integration Flow: Complete message flow from WebView â†’ React Native â†’ Badge working
- DOM Detection: Successfully detects cart count from GreenHaus header badge (`data-count` attribute)
- Edge Cases: Properly handles null values, negative numbers, and large numbers (clamping to 0-999)

### Previous Fix: Cart badge flashing and disappearing
**Problem**: Badge was showing briefly then disappearing. Cart page was constantly reloading.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Three competing cart counters** were racing:
   - `web/injectCartCounter.js` (posting `value`)
   - `lib/webviewSkin.ts` (posting `count`)
   - `components/WebShell.tsx` (duplicate logic)

2. **Message handler mismatch**: Handler looked for `data.count` but injector sent `data.value`

3. **Cart tab force-reloading**: `cart.tsx` called `ref.current?.reload()` on every focus, causing constant page refreshes

4. **No badge persistence**: Badge state reset on tab switches

**Solutions**:
1. Made cart counter script the single source of truth, injected into all WebViews
2. Fixed message handler to read `data.value ?? data.count`
3. Removed duplicate cart detection from `webviewSkin.ts`
4. Removed force-reload from cart tab, kept only focus event
5. Fixed cart URL from `/cart` to `/products/cart`
6. Made `cartBadge.on()` immediately return last known value to new subscribers
7. Implemented active tab gating to prevent background tabs from posting updates

**Result**: Badge now shows correct count, persists across tab switches, no flashing.

## Future Improvements
- Add fallback for offline/error states
- Consider localStorage persistence for badge value
- Add analytics for cart counter accuracy
