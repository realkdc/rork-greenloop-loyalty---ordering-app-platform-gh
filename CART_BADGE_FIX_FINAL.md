# Cart Badge Fix - Final Implementation

## Problem
Cart badge not showing item count on the tab bar, even though items exist in the cart.

## Root Cause
Timing issue - the WebView cart counter script was running but the messages weren't being received reliably due to:
1. Script executing before DOM was fully loaded
2. No retry mechanism on page load
3. Messages being sent before React Native listeners were ready

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cart Counter Script (WebShell.tsx & AppWebView.tsx)
- Added multiple delayed checks: 500ms, 2s, and 4s after page load
- Ensures cart count is detected even if DOM loads slowly
- Script now posts cart count multiple times to catch the React Native listener

### 2. Load End Hook (WebShell.tsx)
- Added PING message on `onLoadEnd` callback
- Forces immediate cart count check when page finishes loading
- 500ms delay ensures DOM is settled

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive console logs throughout the flow:
  - `[GH Cart]` - WebView cart detection logs
  - `[WebShell:tabKey]` - Tab-specific message handling
  - `[AppWebView]` - Message receipt confirmation
  - `[cartBadge]` - State manager updates
  - `[AppContext]` - Context subscription logs
  - `[TabLayout]` - Badge rendering logs

### 4. Message Flow
```
WebView (greenhauscc.com)
  â†’ Cart Counter Script detects count from DOM
  â†’ postMessage({ type: 'CART_COUNT', value: N })
  â†“
WebShell/AppWebView onMessage
  â†’ Parse message
  â†’ Call setCartCount(N)
  â†“
AppContext setCartCount
  â†’ Call cartBadge.set(N)
  â†“
cartBadge manager
  â†’ Emit to all listeners
  â†“
AppContext listener
  â†’ Update cartCount state
  â†“
TabLayout useApp()
  â†’ Render badge when cartCount > 0
```

## Detection Methods (in priority order)
1. **Header badge** - `a.ins-header__icon--cart[data-count]` attribute
2. **Footer text** - "Shopping Bag (N)" text parsing
3. **Cart page** - Count of `.ec-cart__products li` items (only on /products/cart)
4. **Widget counter** - `.ec-cart-widget__counter` or `[data-cart-count]`
5. **Ecwid API** - `window.Ecwid.getCart()` callback (async fallback)

## Files Modified
- `components/WebShell.tsx` - Added delayed PING on load, extended retry timings
- `components/AppWebView.tsx` - Added detailed logging, extended retry timings
- `lib/cartBadge.ts` - Already correct (no changes needed)
- `contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Already correct (no changes needed)
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Already correct (rendering badge properly)

## Testing
1. Add items to cart from any page
2. Switch between tabs
3. Check console for `[GH Cart] Posting to RN: { type: 'CART_COUNT', value: N }`
4. Verify `[WebShell] ðŸ“¨ Cart count received: N` appears
5. Badge should appear on Cart tab with correct count

## Troubleshooting
If badge still doesn't show:
1. Check console for `[GH Cart]` logs - if missing, script isn't running
2. Check for `[WebShell] ðŸ“¨ Message received` - if missing, messages not reaching RN
3. Check for `[cartBadge] âœ… Updating` - if missing, state manager not firing
4. Check for `[TabLayout] ðŸŽ¨ Rendering with cartCount: N` - if N is 0, state not propagating

If you see all logs but no badge:
- Badge CSS might be rendering off-screen
- Check tab layout styles in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
