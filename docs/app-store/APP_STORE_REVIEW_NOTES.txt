App Review Notes - GreenHaus Build 24
==========================================

IMPORTANT: How This App Works
------------------------------

This is a WEBVIEW APP that wraps our existing e-commerce website (greenhauscc.com). We leverage our fully functional Lightspeed e-commerce platform while adding native iOS features.

AUTHENTICATION:
- Uses MAGIC LINKS (SMS/email links) - NO email/password login
- Users enter phone/email → receive link → click to authenticate
- For review: App is pre-configured to auto-authenticate (reviewers can't receive magic links)
- This is NOT a demo mode - it's necessary because reviewers can't receive SMS/email links

PAYMENTS:
- All payments processed by website backend (Lightspeed)
- NO in-app purchases
- NO sandbox/test payments
- Reviewers can view checkout flow but don't need to complete purchase

FULL FUNCTIONALITY:
- Browse products ✅
- Add to cart ✅
- View cart ✅
- Checkout flow ✅
- Order history ✅
- Native iOS features (pull-to-refresh, share, loading states) ✅

WHAT REVIEWERS CAN TEST:
- Open app → Automatically logged in
- Browse products and categories
- Add items to cart
- View checkout flow (no purchase required)
- See order history
- Use native iOS features

WHAT REVIEWERS DON'T NEED:
- Complete real purchase (checkout visible without purchase)
- Enter payment info (payments handled by website)
- Receive magic links (auto-login handles auth)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Platform: React Native + Expo
- WebView: Native iOS WebKit wrapper
- Backend: Lightspeed E-commerce (live production site)
- Payments: Website backend (NOT in-app purchases)
- Authentication: Magic links (passwordless)
- Location: Only when in use (not background)
- Tracking: None (no ATT)

COMPLIANCE:
- ✅ No background location usage
- ✅ No demo/trial messaging
- ✅ Native iOS features implemented
- ✅ Full functionality available
- ✅ Privacy manifest accurate
- ✅ No in-app purchases

This is a production-ready webview app with full e-commerce functionality. The auto-login is a review accommodation for magic link authentication, not a feature limitation.
