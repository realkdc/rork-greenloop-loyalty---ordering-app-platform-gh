# Release Notes

## 2025-10-18
- Updated display name shown on iOS to `GreenHaus`.
- Known issue: profile tab still logs “Email link sent confirmation” when the page reloads before a user triggers the button. Keep banner handling for MVP; follow up post-launch to gate the toast on a verified send event.
